# OPA Guide Book (2022.1)

by Sangkeon Lee (sangkenlee@gmail.com)


# Preface
This book illustrates how to learn and apply the OPA(Open Policy Agent) for software/service development.
And this book is an English translation of a my book about OPA published in South Korea in end of July 2021.

I think the OPA is very cool and excelent technology, but it's hard to learn for the early stage because it's something different and weird than general programming languages.

I serached a book about OPA but some books illustrates about the OPA in few pages, and it's not sufficient to me. So I started to write a book in the mid of 2020. And finished writing first draft in March 2021 and published a korean edition in July 2021.

Because OPA is developing so fast, many features such as print function, in keyword(in future.keywords namespace) is not existed when I writing. And I can illustrates all about OPA ecosystem so it's too large.

For most Korean readers who are more comfortable with Korean, it is recommended to read the Korean version of the book that has already been published to save time. Information about the book can be found at http://acornpub.co.kr/book/opa-book.

Currently, I'm working on my second OPA project,
